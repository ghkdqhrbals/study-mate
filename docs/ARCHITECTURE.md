# BuddyStuddy Architecture

## Overview

BuddyStuddy is a SwiftUI app with shared domain logic across macOS and iOS. The app is intentionally local-first: SQLite/UserDefaults hold the working state, OpenAI is called directly from the client with the user's API key, and CloudKit provides iCloud sync plus iPhone push delivery without a custom backend. Internal target names, bundle identifiers, background task identifiers, and CloudKit record types retain `StudyMate` to avoid breaking existing installs and iCloud data.

## Targets

- `StudyMateiOS`: iOS app and current public release target.
- `StudyMate`: macOS menu bar app, currently not shipped publicly while macOS update/sync UX is paused.
- `StudyMateTests`: unit tests for storage, OpenAI parsing, sync behavior, notification routing, and statistics logic.

## Main Modules

- `Models/StudyModels.swift`
  - Domain models: `StudySettings`, `Difficulty`, `QuestionItem`, `StudyRecord`, `GradingResult`.
  - Display strings through `AppStrings`.
  - Shared topic grouping through `TopicGrouping`.

- `ViewModels/AppState.swift`
  - Main `ObservableObject`.
  - Owns runtime state, drafts, selected tab, sync state, pending question limits, logs, and user actions.
  - Coordinates OpenAI calls, local persistence, CloudKit sync, notifications, and timers.

- `Services/SettingsStore.swift`
  - Local persistence facade.
  - Stores settings, API keys, draft state, logs, CloudKit sync metadata, and delegates records to SQLite.
  - Caps logs at 1000 and records at the configured history limit.

- `Services/OpenAIClient.swift`
  - Uses OpenAI Responses API for question generation and grading.
  - Uses the configured supported model list from `OpenAIModelOption`.
  - Keeps OpenAI usage, cost, and billing management as external OpenAI Platform links.

- `Services/CloudSyncService.swift`
  - Uses the private iCloud database.
  - Stores one snapshot record for app state sync.
  - Stores `StudyMateQuestionPush` records for CloudKit/APNs push delivery.
  - Manages the iOS question push subscription.

- `Services/NotificationService.swift`
  - Handles local notifications, notification actions, iOS remote notification bridge, and macOS study window foregrounding.

- `Views`
  - `StudyView`: active question and pending question workflow.
  - `HistoryView`: record search, pagination, detail, and deletion.
  - `StatisticsView`: topic-level statistics, period filtering, trend charts, and grouped topic stats.
  - `SettingsView`: macOS settings.
  - `MobileRootView`: iOS tabs, onboarding, and settings.

## Data Flow

```text
Timer / manual action / background refresh
-> AppState.generateQuestion
-> OpenAIClient.generateQuestion
-> SettingsStore appends question history and StudyRecord
-> current question updates only when it is safe to activate
-> NotificationService displays local notification
-> CloudSyncService saves sync snapshot / question push record
```

```text
User answer
-> AppState saves answer draft
-> AppState.gradeCurrentAnswer or gradeRecord
-> OpenAIClient.gradeAnswer
-> SettingsStore updates StudyRecord
-> StatisticsView recalculates topic ranges from records
-> CloudKit snapshot sync is scheduled
```

## Sync Model

- Sync is snapshot based, not event sourced.
- The newest CloudKit snapshot usually wins, but local records are merged to avoid losing device-specific history.
- API key sync is supported for the regular OpenAI key.
- Only the regular OpenAI API key is supported by the app.
- If a local ungraded current question has an answer draft, remote current questions do not replace the active answer page.

## Push Model

- CloudKit push is currently iPhone-focused.
- iPhone registers for remote notifications through `UIApplication`.
- iPhone installs a `CKQuerySubscription` for `StudyMateQuestionPush`.
- Mac creates question push records after question generation.
- iPhone receives the CloudKit/APNs notification, fetches the record, syncs, and opens the question only when the user taps or replies.
- iPhone app timers only run while the app process is active. For locked/background delivery, the app opportunistically pre-generates at most one pending question notification when entering background and schedules it for the configured interval. If a question notification is already pending, it does not create another. `BGAppRefresh` is also requested at the next due date, but iOS does not guarantee exact wake-up timing.

## Topic Statistics

- Topic grouping uses `TopicGrouping.normalizedKey`.
- The key removes case, spacing, hyphen, underscore, punctuation, width, and diacritic differences.
- Simple camelCase boundaries are separated before normalization.
- The displayed topic is the most frequent/recent label in the merged group.
- Topic range is estimated from difficulty level and score, then widened by small sample size and conflicting evidence.

## Build And Verification

Recommended local checks:

```sh
xcodebuild -project StudyMate.xcodeproj -scheme StudyMateiOS -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -derivedDataPath build/iOSDeviceDerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -project StudyMate.xcodeproj -scheme StudyMate -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath build/MacTestDerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
```

Use real-device builds when changing iCloud, push, entitlements, or background refresh behavior.
